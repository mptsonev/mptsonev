# Hello there!

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with 4 years of experience in developing quality Web Applications with high availability. Modern technologies excite me and I always strive to be up to speed with current trends. I like simple, clean and reusable code that is properly tested and documented.

I'm passionate about both Software *and* Cooking, so follow along my recipe for a **Great App**.

## How to cook up a great app
### Step one - mix in some business logic and persistance :cocktail:

Every **Great App** needs a good foundation. It has to be robust, scalable and wellrounded. I've used:

* Java (always the latest version :fire:)
* Spring/Spring Boot :rocket:
* Kafka :minibus:
* SQL (preferably PostgreSQL :elephant:)
* NoSQL (Redis and MongoDB :leaves:)
* Python/Django (no more Django templates please :confounded:)

### Step two - build a beautiful presentation

An aesthetic, intuitive UI is a must. My experience is with:

* JavaScript/TypeScript :house_with_garden:
* React, Redux :six_pointed_star:
* HTML(5) :hammer:
* CSS/SASS/LESS :lipstick:

### Step three - Quality Control

Testing is something I take very seriously. I've spent many hours with:

* JUnit (**Unit** testing)
* Mockito/PowerMockito (**Unit** testing)
* Jest (**Unit** testing)
* MochaJS (**Unit** testing)
* Locust (**Load/Stress** testing)
* JMeter (**Load/Stress** testing)
* Selenium (**End to End** testing)

And of course, **Sanity** and **Smoke** tests should be performed for every new release. **Health checks** are also nice :white_check_mark:.

### Step four - put it all together

Building everything together consistently is a must. You won't hear the famous *It runs on my PC* anymore, if you use:

* Maven
* Webpack
* Jenkins
* GoCD
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Helm

### And finally - serve :fork_and_knife:

Once everything is ready, serve it to the users with:

* Tomcat
* WebPack
* Nginx
* Traefik
* HAProxy

### Collect some feedback

What if something does go wrong? Having good logs and monitoring can be crucial. My experience lies with:

* SLF4J
* Kibana
* Logstash
* Datadog
* Java Management Extensions (JMX)
